   Your challenge should you choose to accept it:
   1. Fetch a list of users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
   2. Display the users ID, Name and Email, as a table, where each raw represent a single user
   3. The users should be displayed ordered by ID.
   4. Once a user clicked on a specific raw, the user's name should be striked and pained in red.

   Bonus: 
   It should be possible to reorder the users, by dragging and dropping a user to the appropriate position. When a user position changes, the id of the user should be updated as well to reflect the current position. For example, dragging user #5 to the first position, will update this user ID to be #1, the original first user  ID will become #2, the original second user Id will become #3 and so on.

const App = () => {
  return <div>{/* Implement Me !!! */}</div>;
};

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
